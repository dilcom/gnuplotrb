== iRuby notebooks

This notebooks are powered by {Ruby kernel}[https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/] for {IPython/Jupyter}[https://jupyter.org/].
I placed them here to show some GnuplotRB's capabilities and ways of using it together with iRuby.

=== Installation
To use gnuplot gem with iRuby you need to install them both.

* iRuby installation is covered in its {README}[https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/blob/master/README.md].
  It also covers installation of iPython and other dependecies.
* GnuplotRB gem installation covered in {README}[https://github.com/dilcom/pilot-gnuplot#installation] too.

=== Usage

Using GnuplotRB inside iRuby notebooks is covered in {basic usage notebook}[https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/master/notebooks/basic_usage.ipynb].
